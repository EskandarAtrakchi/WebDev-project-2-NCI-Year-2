# Listings Page Explained

The Listings API provides an overview of all accessible cryptocurrencies. It serves as a comprehensive list of available crypto currencies. Users can use the provided ID to obtain more detailed information about a specific crypto currency by using the ticker endpoint.

When the user clicks on the "Fetch Crypto Data" button, the system retrieves all available cryptocurrencies listed along with their corresponding IDs. Subsequently, a chart is generated to visually represent the available cryptos and their associated IDs on the same page. This chart aids users in quickly checking the listings IDs of various cryptocurrencies.

# Ticker Page Explained

The Ticker API allows users to retrieve data for multiple coins by entering their symbols in the text field, separated by space. The data is then retrieved and displayed in both a chart and as plain text. For example, if the user enters "BTC XRP NEAR SOL," the data for these coins will be retrieved and displayed in the chart and as a table.
